### ERD
[LucidChart ERD](https://lucid.app/invitations/accept/27d080a7-f4b7-420e-90ae-14f3bcc63bad)
----------------------------------------------------------
### User Stories
- As a user, I want to be able to create a database of my clothes. I want to be able to see & organize them by:
    - type (tops, bottoms, one-piece, footwear)
    - style
    - color
    - brand
    - material
- As a user, I want to be able to sort my clothes into KEEP, DONATE, or TRASH
    - KEEP will stay in the closet
    - TRASH will delete them from the closet
    - DONATE will pull up shelters and charities in my area
- As a user, I want to see a list of shelters and charities in my area, and ways to contact them for donation
    - As a user, I want to be able to SAVE my favorite shelters and charities to more easily find them in the future

----------------------------------------------------------
### APIs and other outside tech
- I can't find an API specifically, but there are two websites that look like they'd be good for data scraping:
    - homelessshelterdirectory.org
    - shelterlistings.org
- As a backup, I did find recyclenation.com/recycling-api that includes textile and clothing recycling

Make a PR when you're done and title it with your pod person's name and yours (eg. "Edward<-->Taylor")!
